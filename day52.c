//Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, x;
    printf("Enter size of array: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int arr[n];
    printf("Enter the sorted array elements:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    printf("Enter x: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);

    int index = -1;

    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] >= x) {
            index = i;
            break;   
        }
    }

    printf("%d", index);

    return 0;
}

//output:
//Enter size of array: 7
//Enter the sorted array elements:1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19
//Enter x: 5
//2
